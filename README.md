# Flask-Admin WalrusModel

[Walrus](https://github.com/coleifer/walrus) model backend for the
[Flask-Admin](https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/)

**Note: Work in progress!** See the "Implementation status" section below for details

  * **[Walrus](https://github.com/coleifer/walrus)** is a set of Python
    wrappers for working with Redis and other Redis-like KVS databases
  * **[Flask-Admin](https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/)** is an
    easy-to-use admin interface for the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
    web framework
  * If you don't know what **Flask** is, this repo is probably not for
    you! ;-)

## Introduction

I'm working on a Flask project that makes use of
([rlite](https://github.com/seppo0010/rlite-py)-backed) Walrus models,
and I thought it would be useful to have a generic interface to make the
data manageable with Flask-Admin. So this is primarily to work in my
project, but hopefully it will be useful elsewhere, too.  This is my
first "real" extension so please bear with all the rough edges!

## Setup

The main module is inside the "walrusadmin" folder. Place this in your
`PYTHON_PATH` to get it working. You can then set up your models for
Flask-Admin like so:

    from walrusadmin import ModelView

    # MyModel is the model you want to manage
    from models import MyModel
    
    # ...set up Flask app, Flask-Admin, etc here... #

    admin.add_view(ModelView(MyModel))

You can, of course, subclass `walrusadmin.ModelView` to customize it, as
with any other Flask-Admin ModelView backend

    class UserAdmin(ModelView):
        # ... some config here ...#

    admin.add_view(UserAdmin(MyModel))

For a full example, see the `testapp.py` fileâ€”which is also what I'm
using to check that the admin interface works (no, I haven't got the hang
of unittests yet).

## Implementation status

* [ ] Basic CRUD support
   * [x] for simple field types: TextField, IntegerField, etc.
   * [ ] for aggregate fields types: SetField, HashField, ZSetField
         (current behaviour is to ignore these field types)
* [x] Sorting
* [ ] Search
   * [x] simple
   * [ ] full-text
* [ ] Filters
* [ ] Tests
* [ ] Documentation!
* [ ] Bundle into Python package?

## Contributing

**Note:** Since I don't have Redis installed, I'm using
[rlite](https://github.com/seppo0010/rlite-py) to test
the scripts. You will need to either have the `hirlite` python package
installed, or edit testapp.py to use an actual Redis database.

I'm still at the beginning stage of coding. Feel free to join in with any
of the unimplemented points listed in the "Implementation status" section
above. Any help would be appreciated :-)

And I'm still new to development, so don't worry about messing with my
coding style: I don't have one yet!
